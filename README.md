# Warns Me when anything insect related is on the page 

Similar to a keyword blacklister, this is a Chrome Extension.

- Users have the ability to add their own trigger words which are stored through Chrome's Storage Sync from the Google Chrome Storage API.  
- Using Javascript's Mutation Observer, this extension also accounts for constantly updating webpages such as a scrolling Facebook Newsfeed.
